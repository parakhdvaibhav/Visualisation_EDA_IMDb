The condition is **none of the three actors' Facebook likes should be less than half of the other two**. For example, the following is a valid combo:\n",

    "You can do a manual inspection of the top 5 popular trios you have found in the previous subtask and check how many of those trios satisfy this condition. Also, which is the most popular trio after applying the condition above?"

We also have three genre columns indicating the genres of a particular movie. We will extensively use these columns for the third and the final stage of our assignment wherein we will analyse the voters across all demographics and also see how these vary across various genres.

For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called `add()` in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n",

Since we have the vote counts for both males and females, across various age groups, let's now see how the popularity of genres vary between the two genders in the dataframe. \n",

The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n",
